# Three-Coupled-Oscillators-Interactive-Sim

## Overview
The "Interactive System of Three Coupled Oscillators" is a specialized educational tool aimed at providing an interactive and visual understanding of the dynamics in a system of three coupled oscillators. This tool integrates Python's powerful VPython library for 3D visualization and Tkinter for an intuitive user interface, offering a unique and engaging educational experience.

## Features
- Real-time 3D visualization of a system of three coupled oscillators using VPython.
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to modify initial conditions and physical parameters like mass and spring constants.
- Functionalities to pause, resume, and terminate the simulation on demand.
- Detailed help section to guide users on interacting with the simulation effectively.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system to run this simulation. You can set up the project by cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1Basile/Three-Coupled-Oscillators-Interactive-Sim.git
cd Three-Coupled-Oscillators-Interactive-Sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
Execute the simulation with the following command:
```bash
python CoupledOscillatorsSimulator.py
```

Use the sliders in the Tkinter window to adjust parameters and initial conditions. The VPython canvas will display the simulation in real-time. Control the simulation using the 'spacebar' to pause/resume and the 'q' key or 'Esc' to terminate or exit.
